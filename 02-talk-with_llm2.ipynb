It all started when a group of Kennedy children were playing near the beach and stumbled upon a large, metallic orb partially buried in the sand.\n",

The object was perfectly round and had strange markings etched into its surface. The children immediately ran to get their parents and show them their discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Kennedy family was intrigued and decided to keep the object on their property. They consulted with experts and even contacted NASA, but no one could identify what it was or where it came from. Theories ranged from a piece of space debris to a lost experimental military device.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the most curious part of the story is that the orb seemed to have a strange effect on those who came into contact with it. People reported feeling a sense of calm and clarity when near it, and some even claimed to have had vivid dreams about the future.\n",
